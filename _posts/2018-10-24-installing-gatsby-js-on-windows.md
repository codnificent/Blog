Hi! May I tell you that I'm so happy while writing this post? This is because Gatsby installation gave me lots of troubles but finally, I've got it right. Thanks to the Gatsby's doc. Now I wish to show you how you can do this too.

First, let me tell you what I've gone through. I built my blog (this one) on Jekyll, and I need another blog for fitness [I love fitness so much!] But, I don't want to use Jekyll again. I want to experience other site generators. So, I chose Gatsby because I'm currently learning React.

You can't imagine the trouble the Gatsby installation gave. I researched a lot on how to fix the installation error. I even followed some of the suggestions on the `issues` section of Gatsby on GitHub. I even had to locate my `appdata` and clear the `_libvips` files. But still, nothing works. This was getting complicated to the extent that I wanted to give up.

But I didn't want to give up, because I like how fast Gatsby is. So, I kept on searching until I came upon the Gatsby's own doc on installation of Gatsby on windows. Can you imagine?

I just followed the steps and installed Microsoft visual studio community 2015. And it is! The Gatsby installation was successful!

Go to [Gatsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/) to see the guides. Thanks for reading and I hope that this solves your problem.
