## About me and my mission with this website

My name is Kingsley but you can also call me Kingsley. Yeah, I know. I just repeated myself.
That should give you a picture of who I really am. My life is simple and very serious. I like 
doing crazy things a lot. By crazy I mean anything I can do to make you smile and understand my
point of view at the same time.

I'm a student of computer science. I love coding and going for workouts. Feel free to hit me up - we can be friends
