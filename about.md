### About me

I'm a student of computer science. I've been working with the web for a while now. And, I believe I'm good enough to share information about web development in general. That's why I created this website - to share info.

The integrity of what I share to the world matters a lot. So, there's nothing to hide about myself. If you wish to know more about me, click any of the links in the footer section. Or,perhaps you could just contact me instead.

#### Thank you for visiting my little world
